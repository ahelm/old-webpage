              My name is Anton, and I have a Ph.D. in physics. I have been using
              large supercomputers to model the interaction between intense laser
              pulses and plasmas in the past years. It led me to develop numerical
              models to run on a large number of computers.

            </p>
            <p>

              I can characterize my interest as everything tech. During the time in
              academia, I acquired a deep knowledge of computer architectures,
              including GPUs. I also adore Python as it allows me to quickly and
              programmatically solve problems at any scale. I am currently getting
              into deep learning and exploring all the possible angles of using it. I
              also really like the math behind it as it is quite interesting to model
              and connects to my previous work, using computers as big calculators.
